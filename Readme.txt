Secure Data Hiding in Image Using Steganography

📌 About the Project

This project demonstrates image-based steganography, a technique for hiding secret messages inside images. Unlike encryption, which makes data unreadable, steganography ensures that the hidden message remains undetectable to unauthorized users. This implementation uses Python, OpenCV, and NumPy to embed and extract messages securely.

✨ Key Features

Secure Message Embedding – Hides text inside images without noticeable distortion.

Passcode Protection – Ensures only authorized users can decrypt messages.

XOR-Based Encryption – Adds an extra layer of security.

Graphical User Interface (GUI) – Easy-to-use interface built with Tkinter.

Cross-Platform Support – Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Tkinter
